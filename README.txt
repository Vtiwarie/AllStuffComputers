AllStuffComputers was created by Vishaan Tiwarie.

It is a Zend Framework Application that uses the Zend MVC framework to
create all source code used for the site.  

The site also partners with Amazon.com for eCommerce monetization. 

Currently, AllStuffComputers runs on a test server, but is aimed to go
completely live in just a few months.
